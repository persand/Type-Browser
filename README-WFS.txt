============================================================================

Thanks for downloading Web Font Specimen! Enclosed you will find example 
HTML, CSS, and image files, plus an empty folder in which to put your type.

One of the CSS files is Eric Meyer's reset.css; if you prefer a different 
stylesheet for resetting default browser styling, swap it out. Another of 
the CSS files is part of Nathan Smith's 960.gs, used for layout.

HOW TO USE:


1) Add a typeface to the css/type/ folder

   Make sure the typeface you want to try is licensed for use with the CSS 
   @font-face property. (Not sure? Check the typeface's EULA.) The typefaces 
   featured at http://webfontspecimen.com are okay to use.


2) Edit index.html

   In the HTML's embedded CSS, update the @font-face property and font stack. 
   The value "Font name" is arbitrary, but must be the same in both spots 
   (@font-face declaration and body declaration).


3. Label the HTML with your typeface's name

   - Line 6, <title>Font name - Web Font Specimen</title>
   - Line 31, <h1>Font name</h1>
   - Line 67, <th>Font name</th>
   

4. Preview index.html in a browser!

ADDITIONAL READING:


Web Font Specimen is designed to be quick and easy. Naturally, out of the 
box it does not work in Internet Explorer. But with a little extra effort 
and some advice from the pros, we can improve browser compatibility.

"How to use CSS @font-face" walks you through the concepts:

USING WITH TYPE DELIVERY SERVICES:


If you're using Web Font Specimen to try out typefaces from a type delivery 
service like Typekit, Typotheque, or Kernest, you'll need to remove the 
embedded CSS (the CSS in index.html) on lines 10-18 and add whatever code
your service requires.

Just be sure the type delivered by your service is being applied to 
the "body" HTML element selector.
